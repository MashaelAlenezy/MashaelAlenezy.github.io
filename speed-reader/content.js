Successful visions are based on strong pillars.
The first pillar of our vision is our status as
the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds. We
recognize that Allah the Almighty has given
to our country, a gift more precious than oil.
Saudi Arabia is the Land of the Two Holy
Mosques, the most sacred sites on earth and
the direction of the Kaaba (Qibla) to which
more than a billion Muslims turn at prayer. We
will expand and further develop our country
to ensure that that Muslims from around the
world can visit the Holy Sites.
The second pillar of our vision is our
determination to become a center for global
business. We will develop the economy to
encourage investment from other countries
and international businesses.
The third pillar is transforming our unique
geographical location into a global hub
connecting three continents, Asia, Europe and
Africa. We will use our geographical position
to improve trade and transport to and from
our country.
Although our country is rich in its natural
resources, our real wealth lies in the ambition
of our people and the potential of our younger
generation. They are our nation’s pride and
the architects of our future. We will support
young people in finding jobs and training.
Our vision is built around three themes: A
vibrant society, a thriving economy and an
ambitious nation.
The first theme is vital to achieving the
vision. We believe in the importance of a
vibrant society. Members of this society
live in accordance with the Islamic principle
of moderation, are proud of their national
identity and their ancient cultural heritage,
enjoy a good life, are protected by caring
families and are supported by a social and
health care system. The government is
committed to supporting families and the
education and wellbeing of their children.
In the second theme, a thriving economy
provides opportunities for all by building an
education system that meets the needs of the
market. It creates economic opportunities
for small enterprises as well as large
corporations. Therefore, we will develop
and diversify our economy to create job
opportunities.
Our third theme-an ambitious nation-is
built on a responsible, transparent and
high-performing government. We will apply
efficiency and responsibility at all levels.
We will also prepare the right environment
for our citizens, businesses and society to be
responsible and take the initiative in facing
challenges and seizing opportunities.
We are confident about Saudi Arabia’s future.
With all the blessings Allah has given us,
we cannot help but be optimistic about the
decades ahead.
The future of our country is one of huge
promise and great potential. Our precious
country deserves the best.
Our vision, grounded in our country’s
strengths, will deliver this stability and create
a brighter future for our country and our
people.` },
